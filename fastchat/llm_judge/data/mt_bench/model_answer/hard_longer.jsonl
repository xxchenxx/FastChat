This means that a particle can be in two different places at the same time, or have two different properties at the same time. This is in contrast to classical physics, which states that a particle can only be in one place at a time. \n\nQuantum entanglement is a phenomenon that occurs when two or more particles interact in such a way that their properties become linked. This means that the properties of one particle are dependent on the properties of the other particle, even if they are separated by a large distance.
