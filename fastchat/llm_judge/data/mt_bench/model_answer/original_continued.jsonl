Riemannian geometry differs from Euclidean geometry in that it is non-Euclidean, meaning that its properties do not follow the same rules as Euclidean geometry. \n\nIn Riemannian geometry, the metric tensor is used to define the geometry of the manifold. This metric tensor provides a way to measure distances, angles, and other geometric properties. It also provides a way to define curvature, which is a measure of how the manifold curves. Riemannian geometry also allows for the study of surfaces, such as spheres and ellipsoids, that are not possible in Euclidean geometry.\n\nIn Euclidean geometry, there are only two dimensions, and the properties of geometry are defined by a set of axioms. Riemannian geometry, on the other hand, is defined by a metric tensor, which is a more complex object than the axioms of Euclidean geometry. \n\nRiemannian geometry is also used in the study of black holes, as it allows for the study of space-time curvature. It can also be used to study the behavior of quantum particles and the behavior of matter at the atomic level. \n\nFinally, Riemannian geometry has applications in modern physics, such as the study of the gravitational field of the universe."]}], "tstamp": 1703208397.7504292}
